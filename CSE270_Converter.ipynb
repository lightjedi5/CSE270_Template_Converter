To accomplish this, three things will be provided: </p><ol><li>a description of the Code &amp; Fix development methodology, </li><li>a description of the scenario to which you will apply the Code &amp; Fix methodology, and </li><li>a description of the assignment expectations</li></ol><p><strong>Backstory</strong></p><p>You are the owner of a small company that solves software problems for companies by contract by contract. (Not a App startup, or COTS).You are currently working on your 1<sup>st</sup> project with your partner (for this week your partner is fictious, in week 03, you will be assigned a partner). You must finish the project in 3 months. Neither of you are familiar with full-scale software development nor the methodologies associated with it. </p><p>You are making a mobile application that keeps track of home maintenance. Banks have found that individual homeowners that make routine maintenance on their home have a less likely of faulting on their loan, and will lower insurance costs. </p><p>You and your partner must make a small business plan for your bank to give you a loan. The bank requires the plan to include meetings, deliverables, specific roles, and reports. </p><p><strong>Instruction</strong></p><p>Small Business plan outline</p><ul><li>Title Page: Home Maintenance Tracker, Company Name</li><li>Section 1<ul><li>Purpose (Given): Bank Associate Nation Keeper, Inc (B.A.N.K.,Inc) desires a mobile application that will keep track of home maintenance. This include keeping track of electricity, appliance upkeep, yard maintenance and periodic cleaning. Much like proper automobile maintenance, it is worth sizeable insurance deduction for the bank who want to pass the savings down to the homeowner to keep the investment from default back to the bank.</li><li>Scope (Given): The application will be an mobile application that will require home owners to update a monthly checklist, to get a discount on their next monthly PITI (Principle, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance). </li><li>Features (Given): The following are examples of types of reporting the application needs to be include in the monthly checklist, but not necessarily checked every month but every 2, 4, 6, 12 months. <ul><li>Home Hardware: Toilets, Sinks, Floors, Wall, Roof, Siding, Concrete </li><li>Home Software: HVAC, Water Heater</li><li>Electronics: Light bulbs, Wall Sockets,  </li><li>Yard: Landscaping, Sprinkler System, Fence, Gutters &amp; Irrigation, Concrete Walkways and Driveways. </li><li>Appliances: Washer, Dryer, Refrigerator, Dishwasher, Stove.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Section 2: Meetings<ul><li>Periodically the customer, the bank would like you to have a meeting updating the status. These meeting include stakeholder meetings, Kickoff meetings, Design meetings, and Delivery meetings. Any other meeting would be good to schedule as you so desire. With the meeting you will determine you when and how often you should meet. </li></ul></li><li>Section 4: Deliverable<ul><li>This section should include all deliverable that you will provide as proof of progress and status. </li><li>These meeting can include the following: Design Document, Bug/Peer Reviews, Features, Bug List, Test (Unit/Regression)</li></ul></li><li>Section 5: Checkpoints<ul><li>There are some events that need to be done in order to proceed to the next phase or maturity of a project. </li><li>Identify at least 5 different checkpoints. </li></ul></li><li>Section 6: Schedule<ul><li>Put all the Meetings, Deliverables and Checkpoints  in to a 3-month schedule. </li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Make it your Own</strong></p><p> As you finish the B.A.N.K.’s Small Business Plan, contemplate on the viability of your plan. Imagine that you really are the owner of this company and you have a significant financial stake in the outcome of this contract. </p><p>Strength of the Plan: Do you feel this plan is viable? Do you think it will make the best use of your available resources? </p><p>Weakness of the Plan: Are there risks this methodology introduces or fails to address?</p><p><strong>Submission</strong></p><p>Please submit a single .DOCX file through I-Learn with your last name as the file name. If your last name is &quot;Smith,&quot; the file name would be Smith_01.docx</p><p><strong>Rubric</strong></p><p>Your grade for this activity will be according to the following rubric:</p><table><tr><td><p><strong> </strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Exceptional<br />100%</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Good<br />90%</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Acceptable<br />70%</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Developing<br />50%</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Missing<br />0%</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Plan (80%)</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Additional content is present found in reading or from experience (marked green/bold)</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Additional suggested content is present (marked as red/bold)</strong></p></td><td><p>All content in assignment is present</p></td><td><p>All sections are present</p></td><td><p>One or more missing sections (Title, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 is missing)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Make it Your Own/Reflection<br />10%</strong></p></td><td><p>The reflection cuts to the heart of the strengths and weaknesses of the development methodology.</p></td><td><p>The strengths and weakness of reflect to the methodology and are clearly communicated.</p></td><td><p>Both and more than 1 strength and weakness of the plan </p></td><td><p>Identified 1 strength or 1 weakness of the plan</p></td><td><p>No reflection is present, but just a self-assessment. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Professionalism<br />10%</strong></p></td><td><p>The paper is easy to read and ideas are clearly communicated.</p></td><td><p>Everything is properly cited, there are no grammar or spelling errors, and writing style is &quot;professional.&quot;</p></td><td><p>One instance of a spelling error, grammar error, incomplete citation, overly verbose, poor formatting, or poor writing.</p></td><td><p>A citation is missing where one is needed (plagiarism alert!).</p></td><td><p>Gross spelling/grammar errors or other aspects of the writing that make the paper difficult to read.</p></td></tr></table>\n"

      "<strong>Prepare</strong></p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>What are Software Methodologies? Software methodologies are methods to develop software, including life cycle phases and representational models. In this class we are going to cover several of the most common methodologies and help you understand how they affect software engineering, development, and programming. </p><p>One of the first methodologies was simply code and fix. We do this a lot in academia, mostly because the tasks are small and already planned and well tested. Many other fields do the same, such as an artist’s painting a picture, does it look right, nope fix a little there and then paint some more. Another example is a writing a paper, write the first draft and revise, 2nd draft and revise. This goes for any creative process and research and development. This is a natural process of coming up with small units. </p><p>Things get a bit more interesting when you start making larger projects, and adding more people to the mix in developing the ideas into a product that one person can do by themselves. As we proceed into the next couple of weeks we will talk about the risks and mitigation of those risks have arise different methodologies through the history of software engineering.</p><p><strong>Objectives</strong></p><p>By the end of the week, each student will be able to: </p><ul><li>Critique the quality of a given article and identify the assumptions on which an author’s conclusions were made</li><li>Recognize the limitations of the “code and fix” methodology</li><li>Identify the types of problems that software models are designed to address</li></ul><p><strong>Weekly Schedule</strong></p><p><a id=\"_Hlk45122994\"></a>CSE 270 is a 3-credit class. 3 hours of class time (Teach).
